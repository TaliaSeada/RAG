# RAG
Document-based Conversational AI System for LangGraph Information Retrieval

Overview
This task aims to create a conversational AI system capable of answering questions about LangGraph by retrieving and synthesizing information from provided sources. Using the provided articles and repositories, I built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that retrieves information from a knowledge base and answers questions with a conversational interface.
